# RocketTuner
It rocks!

Tuning Application. Actually a rocket-fast sine-wave noise generator for musical/pitch identification/correction purposes. It's fine to physically accurate tones and scales (currently only equal temperament) for musical instrument tuning. With good  loudspeakers, headphones (recommended) with proper frequency range, the user can compare the real life voice/sound pitch with the digital source from RocketTuner. Tested with real instruments, in professional work enwironment on a daily basis. It's good for You.
